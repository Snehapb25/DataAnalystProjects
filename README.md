📊 COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis



 **Project Overview**



This project analyzes COVID-19 clinical trial data to understand trends in trial status, phases, enrollment size, sponsors, and geographic distribution.

The analysis is performed using Python with data visualization to extract meaningful insights from real-world clinical trial data.



 **Tools \& Libraries Used**



Python



Pandas – data cleaning \& manipulation



NumPy – numerical operations



Matplotlib – data visualization



Seaborn – statistical visualizations



Jupyter Notebook



**Dataset**



Source: COVID-19 Clinical Trials dataset (CSV format)



**Key Columns Used:**

&nbsp;**Analysis \& Visualizations**



The following insights were explored using charts and graphs:



🔹 Trial Status Analysis



Distribution of trials by status (Recruiting, Completed, Not yet recruiting, etc.)



🔹 Trial Phases



Phase-wise distribution of clinical trials



Pie chart excluding Not Applicable / Not Available phases



🔹 Enrollment Size



Categorized interventional trials into:



Small (≤100)



Medium (101–500)



Large (501–1000)



Very Large (>1000)



🔹 Lead Sponsors



Top 10 organizations sponsoring COVID-19 clinical studies



🔹 Geographic Distribution



Top countries conducting COVID-19 clinical trials



 **Key Insights**



Most COVID-19 trials were initiated in 2020, reflecting the pandemic response.



Recruiting and Completed trials dominate the dataset.



Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials account for the largest share, showing focus on treatment effectiveness.



The majority of interventional trials have small to medium enrollment sizes.



Major contributors include public hospitals, universities, and national research institutes.





 **Conclusion**



This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can uncover meaningful insights from healthcare data. It highlights global efforts in COVID-19 research and showcases practical Python skills relevant for a Data Analyst role.
